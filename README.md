### **Project 1: "ZanBoard" - A Beginner-Friendly Personal Dashboard**

  

- **Skills**: React components, JSX, Tailwind CSS, API calls, Next.js basics, and deployment on Vercel.

  

- **Description**: Build a **simple personal dashboard** that combines productivity and mindfulness. Keep the functionality straightforward while still making it visually appealing and fun to use. Widgets include:

    - **Weather & Mood**: A weather widget that displays the current weather and suggests a simple activity (e.g., "Sunny: Take a 5-minute walk!" or "Rainy: Perfect time for tea").

    - **Quote of the Day**: Fetch a motivational quote using a public API (e.g., [ZenQuotes](https://zenquotes.io/)).

    - **Daily Goals**: A simple to-do list to add and check off daily goals.

    - **Gratitude Prompt**: A small text area where users can jot down one thing they're grateful for.

- **Unique Spin**:

    - **Daily Theme Change**: The dashboard background changes colors or patterns based on the weather or time of day (e.g., sunrise/sunset colors in the morning/evening).

    - **Mood Badge**: At the end of the day, display a badge based on user input, such as "Productive," "Grateful," or "Relaxed."

    - **Minimal Animations**: Add subtle animations, such as smooth hover effects or a transition when toggling between tasks.

- **Outcome**:

    - Learn the basics of React components and state management.

    - Get comfortable with fetching data from public APIs.

    - Practice styling with Tailwind CSS.

    - Understand the basics of deployment on Vercel.
